# OP Amp RC Phase Shift Oscillator
An electrical oscillator circuit that generates sine waves is known as a phase shift oscillator. Either a transistor or an Op-amp can be used to design the inverting amplifier. In an RC phase shift oscillator, the RC network will be formed in feedback path, The amplifier provides a 180 degree of phase shift due to inverting in nature and the feedback path will also prodvide 180 degree of phase shift(To get the sustained oscillations, in the RC phase shift oscillator), so the overall phase shift will be 360 degree (or zero degree) and by tuning the gain of this amplifier and the feedback circuit it is possible to achieve the loop gain that is equal to 1.

 We have calculated the frequency of oscillation using the time period of the stable periodic waveform. The frequency will be inverse of time period.
